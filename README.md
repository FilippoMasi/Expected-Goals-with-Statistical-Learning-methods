# Expected-Goals-with-Statistical-Learning-methods
The aim of the project is to find some models that enable you to estimate the probability that a shot is a goal, given the features of this shots. At the end of the project there is the comparison of the different models. 
Models are created with a datasets composed of features of thousands of shots on target of Barcellona football team (from 2006-2019).
